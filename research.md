## Research

I investigate and innovate in the areas of _artificial intelligence_ (neural networks) and _data science_. Though my research I try to answer the following questions:

1. How to design fast, robust, optimal, efficient learning systems? For example, lightweight or distilled
networks, explainable and inferable neural networks and learning systems, adversarially robust and
secure networks, and cost and energy efficient networks.
1. How to effectively solve challenging interdisciplinary problems? For example, image data (e.g., medical imaging), environment
data (e.g. hydrology), climate data (e.g., chaotic systems).
1. How biological neurons behave and how to inform design of biologically plausible neural networks?

Following are examples of my works toward answering these questions:


### Research Supervision
#### Current Postdoc
Remy Vandaele (2020–), Machine learning for high impactweather and flood prediction (co-supervision
with <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sws01sld/" target="_blank">Prof Sarh Dance</a> of Mathematics Department), UoR, UK. (current output: <a href="https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/93823/" target="_blank">paper</a> and a <a href="https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/25/4435/2021/" target="_blank">journal</a>)

**Project**: _We investigate how Transfer Learning and Semantic Segmentation can be applied to predict flood events. We use river Camra Images of FasonDigital Watercams as our data source and the past flood events of the UK as case studies. Our to-date results have successfully demonstrated use to Transfer Learning with an accuracy above 91%  for the flood event on the rivers Severn and Avon, UK. Currently, we are trying to investigate a large volume of data by combining river gauge data time-series with image data time-series and offering an automated flood monitoring system_.

#### Current PhD Student Projects
Chandresh Parvin (2019–2022), Signal Processing for the Robustness Analysis of Deep Neural Networks, UoR (status: a paper and a near submission journal)

**Questions**: _We investigate methodologies to expose the weaknesses of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. Our aim is to answer questions relating to what and why adversaries target some specific features from a learned representation instead of others.  We aim to evaluate the structural robustness of deep neural networks with respect to a clean dataset and the dataset applied to a single-step adversarial perturbation in the input space with respect to increasing generalization loss. We aim to apply signal processing techniques to perturb neural synapses, both globally and locally, to analyze how the network response varies for the perturbed and unperturbed inputs_.

Daniel Ayers (2019–2022) Using supervised learning to estimate local instabilities in chaotic systems: computation of local Lyapunov exponents, UoR (status: a poster and a near submission journal)

**Questions**: _In dynamical systems such as those to predict the weather, prediction errors grow faster in some situations than in others. Knowledge about the growth of prediction errors at the current time could enable strategies to quantify or mitigate error growth. The theory of Lyapunov exponents measures the rate at which very small prediction errors grow. Calculating Lyapunov exponents exactly requires the tangent linear model and orthogonalization algorithms. These are computationally expensive. We investigate whether supervised machine learning can provide a cheaper alternative. Specifically, we test the ability of popular supervised learning methods to predict the local Lyapunov exponents in two low-dimensional chaotic dynamical systems. We find that the predictions are accurate in certain cases, and we suggest how this difference in performance might be explained_.

Rhian Taylor (2020–2023) Sensitivity Analysis of Deep Neural Networks, UoR, UK. (1 paper)

**Questions**: _We investigate novel approaches to ranking and understanding the influence of deep learning (DL) hyper-parameters through the application of sensitivity analysis (SA). We investigate how shallow and deeper models are susceptible to hyper-parameters affecting their convergence profiles. We try to understand how the stochasticity of the learning process of deeper models showed sensitivity to hyper-parameters and how hyperparameters influence the convergence speed. Additionally, we try to understand how the complexity of the dataset can affect the margin of separation between the sensitivity measures of the most and the least influential parameters_.
