## Research

I investigate and innovate in the areas of _artificial intelligence_ (neural networks) and _data science_. Though my research I try to answer the following questions:

1. How to design fast, robust, optimal, efficient learning systems? For example, lightweight or distilled
networks, explainable and inferable neural networks and learning systems, adversarially robust and
secure networks, and cost and energy efficient networks.
1. How to effectively solve challenging interdisciplinary problems? For example, image data (e.g., medical imaging, river camera images), environment
data (e.g. hydrology), climate data (e.g., chaotic systems).
1. How biological neurons behave and how to inform design of biologically plausible neural networks?

Following are examples of my works toward answering these questions:
