## Research

<!-- <sub>[Research Supervision](#research-supervision)</sub> -->

I work on Deep Learning and Machine Learning. My recent major focus has been Adversarial Deep Learning and Neural Architecture Search and Analysis. I apply Artificial Intelligence to solve complex Engineering and Science problems of a highly interdisciplinary nature. I am open to collaborating with researchers from a diverse range of disciplines. My recent major interdisciplinary works include Flood Monitoring, Climate Science, Civil Engineering, and System Biology. I encourage you to walk through some examples of research work on this page.

<!-- Example of our work on this webpage should encourage.   My main focus is on neural networks. I am interested in sparse neural computation in order to create fast, robust, and optimal learning systems. I am currently working on neural networks and deep learning, focusing on neural architecture search and analysis to achieve this goal. I aim to integrate inspiration from neuroscience to inform neural design in the long term. I like to collaborate with interdisciplinary researchers where problems introduce challenges to deep learning, neural networks, and optimization. Do read examples of my work and do get in touch at v.k.ojha[at]reading.ac.uk. -->
## Major Funded Project
I am leading the Artificial Intelligence Theme (as one of the Co-I) of the EPSRC-funded National Edge AI Hub. The National Edge AI Hub is a ~12m GBP project.  

## Deep Learning 
(_Security, Explainability and Trustworthiness of AI_) <br>
My original works have been about developing algorithms like **Backpropagation Neural Tree** with a long-term goal of developing neuroscience-informed new neural network algorithm design. The image below shows the computation of this neural tree algorithm and other computational models of the literature.

**Figure.** Biologically plausible neural computation of dendritic trees. The red circle represents a neuron (soma), black lines are dendrites, and the numbers indicate inputs. Left is a biological neuron model (Travis et al., 2005), the middle is a single neuron dendritic tree (Jones and Kording, 2021), and the right is the proposed backpropagation neural tree (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.02248.pdf" target="_blank"> Ojha et al. 2022 </a>). Check previous related work on trees (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05592" target="_blank">Ojha et al 2016</a> and <a a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05769" target="_blank">Ojha et al 2017</a>). Students interested in the topics of **neural networks** and **deep learning** network architecture analysis (e.g., using adversarial robustness) and exploring neuroscience, information theory, or complex network literature for PhD research are welcome!


## Adversarial Deep Learning

**Figure.** Adversarial attacks on deep learning: explainability, compactness, adversarial robustness (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09821" target="_blank">Pravin et al. 2023</a>). Also, check our previous work on the attacks on fragile neurons of deep neural networks (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12347" target="_blank">Pravin et al. 2021</a>). 

## Deep Learning and Computer Vision
(_Image Segmentation, Object Detection, Transfer Learning_) <br>
In my recent Computer Vision work, we investigated how Transfer Learning and Semantic Segmentation can be applied to a time series of images (see Fig below) to predict flood events on the rivers (Severn and Avon, UK). Our to-date results have successfully demonstrated use to Transfer Learning with an accuracy above 91% for these flood events (check out our research: <a href="https://centaur.reading.ac.uk/93823/" target="_blank">Vandaele et al. 2020</a> and <a href="https://hess.copernicus.org/articles/25/4435/2021/" target="_blank">Vandaele et al. 2021</a>).

## Interdisciplinary Research
I like to work on **interdisciplinary research** and **data science** projects. For example, I work with Civil Engineering researchers on the following problem.
A _Civil Engineering_ problem was solved by applying AI algorithms. In structural engineering, large steel constructions, such as bridges and domes, are built, whose structural response is characterised by large displacements and are vulnerable to progressive collapses due to buckling effects, leading to sudden failures. A thorough analysis of such buckling was done using optimisation algorithms.

**Figure.** Twenty-Four Member Shallow Truss Structure. Left: Top View and Side View of the structure.
The central node of the structure is indicated by a lighter colour dot and arrow. The arrow indicates a vertical downward external force. Right: The results of the adaptive search space decomposition method (Center) applied on this benchmark (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.07519.pdf" target="_blank"> Ojha et al. 2022 </a>).

I recommend watching the following video explaining a range of interdisciplinary research projects I have had the opportunity to work on. This talk was for AI starters and will provide a simplified overview of AI and its application.
