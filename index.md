## Varun Ojha, PhD

Lecturer (Assistant Professor), University of Reading, United Kingdom

**Research Interest**
I work on Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data Science, and Applied Artificial Intelligence. <br> My work has been highly interdisciplinary in nature, especially in solving complex and challenging engineering and science problems.


**Short Bio**

I am a researcher in Artificial Intelligence. I work on Neural Networks,  Machine Learning, Optimization, and Data Science. I am currently a lecturer in Computer Science at the <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Reading</a>, UK. Previously as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html" target="_blank">Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich)</a>, Zurich, Switzerland, I led a team of researchers to investigate the human perception of dynamic urban environments using machine learning. Before this, I was a Marie-Curie Fellow at the  <a href="https://www.vsb.cz/en" target="_blank">Technical University of Ostrava</a>, Czech Republic. I received a PhD degree in Computer Science from the Technical University of Ostrava, the Czech Republic. In my early career, I received a research fellowship position funded by the Govt of India's Dept of Science and Technology at the <a href="https://visvabharati.ac.in/index.html" target="_blank">Visva-Bharati University</a>, India, to develop an intelligent system for mixed toxic gas pattern recognition. My research works are available in <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/publications">Publications</a>,  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bNLfWwgl4J4C&hl=en" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a>, and <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9256-1192" target="_blank">ORCID</a>.
