**Hi, nice to see you here!**

What I like the most is how much we learn working with people, the act of doing research, the efforts to break the barrier, and the joy achievements. These experiences drive my research whether it is my current work as a lecturer in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.reading.ac.uk/computer-science/) of the [University of Reading](http://www.reading.ac.uk/), UK, or my prior works as a researcher at the [Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich)](https://ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland, the [Technical University of Ostrava](https://www.vsb.cz/en), the Czech Republic, and [Visva-Bharti Unversity](https://visvabharati.ac.in/index.html), Santiniketan India. You can find my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/publications">publications</a> in [DBLP](https://dblp.org/pid/119/4926.html), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bNLfWwgl4J4C&hl=en), and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9256-1192).
