## Teaching

My teaching interests are in _Artificial Intelligence_ and _Data Science_ areas. I like to teach project-driven _programming_, _algorithms and data structure_, and _engineering mathematics_.

### Life Cycle of Teaching a Course
Teaching is a _learning system_ where a feedback loop is paramount in perfecting and stabilizing the system. I sketched this thought in the following image.<br>
