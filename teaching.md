## Teaching

My teaching interests are in _Artificial Intelligence_ and _Data Science_ areas. I like to teach project-driven _programming_, _algorithms and data structure_, and _engineering mathematics_.

### Examples of Innovations in Teaching & Learning
1. As a _degree project coordinator_, I improved the students and staff experiences by introducing **novel and innovative ideas** like a) staff-student interaction sessions (e.g., poster session and academic tutor meeting session), b) project-based supervisor allocation scheme, c) gradation based assessment marking rubric, d) online assessment strategy during Covid-19 crisis, e) weekly timetabled supervisory meeting to improve communication, f) professional skills training sessions for student support, g) introduced a <a href="https://tinyurl.com/uorcs" target="_blank">departmental report template and writing guide</a>, and h) a formal scheme for the cooperation with industries on final year projects. (Department of Computer Science, University of Reading, 2019 - 2021)
1. As a _Programming in Java_ module convener, I planned to divide the weekly tasks into small chunks of easy, medium, and hard levels like in computer games. I colour-coded them like a traffic-light system: green, orange, and red. The objective was that once they see an easy task, they will do it, which will prompt interest to do another one. The scores of students on weekly formative assessments on questions related to weekly tasks drastically improved, and attendance and engagement of students in the Lab improved significantly on this module. (Programming in Java, Department of Computer Science, University of Reading, 2021)

### Life Cycle of Teaching a Course
I think of Teaching as a _learning system_ where a feedback loop is paramount in perfecting and stabilizing the system. I sketched this thought in the following image.<br>
